# 💀StealthCrypter💀

## 📜 Description
StealthCrypter is a powerful and easy-to-use encryption tool that helps you protect your sensitive files and directories using **AES-256 encryption**. Whether you need to safeguard personal documents or secure confidential data, CryptShield ensures that your files remain private and tamper-proof.

## 🔑 Features
✅ **AES-256 Encryption** – Industry-standard encryption for maximum security.  
✅ **Interactive CLI** – No need for command-line arguments; just follow the prompts.  
✅ **Encrypt & Decrypt Files or Directories** – Protect multiple files at once with ease.  
✅ **Secure Key Input** – Uses a hashed key for enhanced security.  
✅ **Progress Bar** – Shows real-time encryption/decryption progress.  
✅ **Handles Large Files** – Reads and writes data in chunks to avoid memory issues.  
✅ **Optional Auto-Delete** – Allows users to securely remove original files after encryption.  

## 🚀Step-by-Step Guide in Linux Terminal !

Step 1: Update & upgrade your system  
>sudo apt update  

>sudo apt upgrade  

Step 2: install Dependencies  
>sudo apt install python3-tqdm  

>sudo apt install python3-pycryptodome  
 
Step 3: Clone the repository  
>git clone https://github.com/The-Real-Virus/StealthCrypter.git  

Step 4: Go to the Tool Directory where u clone it  
>cd StealthCrypter  

Step 5: After Completing the process now u can run script  
>python3 crypter.py  

## 💡 Tips!
🔹 Use a **strong passphrase** to ensure maximum security. The script hashes your input to generate a secure 32-byte key.  
🔹 Keep a backup of your **encryption key** – Without it, decryption is impossible!  
🔹 Make sure you have the **required dependencies** installed before running the script (see below).  

## 🤝 Follow the Prompts!
1️⃣ Run the script:  

2️⃣ Choose an action:
   ```
   [1] Encrypt a file
   [2] Decrypt a file
   [3] Encrypt a directory
   [4] Decrypt a directory
   ```
3️⃣ Enter the file or directory path.  
4️⃣ Enter a **secure passphrase** (used for encryption & decryption).  
5️⃣ The script will process the files with a **progress bar**.  
6️⃣ You’ll be asked if you want to **delete the original files** after encryption.  

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting
**Q: I forgot my encryption key. Can I recover my files?**  
❌ **No.** The encryption key is never stored. If lost, decryption is impossible.  

**Q: The script is not recognized. What should I do?**  
✅ Make sure Python is installed also see requirements.txt and run it using `python3 crypter.py` if necessary.  

**Q: How do I install the required dependencies?**  
✅ Run the following command:  
   ```sh
   install the requirements (step 2 above) also see requirements.txt.
   ```
